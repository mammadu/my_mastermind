# my_mastermind

***

## Task

Create a program that will play the Mastermind game.

## Description

I created structs to hold flags and created functions to validate the flags.
I then set the secret code and attempt count based on the flags.
I then created a while loop to read the user input and evaluate if it matches the secret code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory in the terminal
2. In the terminal enter `make` to compile the program

## Usage

```sh
./my_mastermind //play master mind with a random secret code and 10 attempts
```

```sh
./my_mastermind -c 1234 -t 20 //play master mind with secret code 1234 and 20 attempts
```
